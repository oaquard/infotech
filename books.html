        <p><b><u>To Live, by Yu Hua (1992)</u></b></p>
        <br>
        <p>The very first book I read this year is also very likely the best novel I'll read this year as well.</p>
        <p>To Live has one of the most interesting conventions a novel can have for me: a nested narrative. The book begins to be told from the perspective
            of a Chinese folk song collector (very remnicent of our own Alan Lomax in America) named "I". I hears of a man named Fugui, who has an ox that he
            has also named Fugui, that he is told has a remarkable life story to tell.
