            <br>
            <p>Okay, so this one is <em>technically</em> a television show, but in its newly remastered form it has been presented as a film in town
                parts everywhere it has screened (Harvard, Anthology Film Archives, other places probably). English subtitles aren't available yet, at least
                not on the web, but I'll try and link one of my favorite scenes below.</p>
            <p>The movie is technically Yugoslavian, as Serbia was a Yugoslavian country at the time, but Karpo Godina toured around what we know as Northern
                Serbia to find the most remarkable (read: weirdest) people he could find among the rural countrysides. Featuring: the liars club, 
                the fastest walkers in the world, the man who drove his car on the wall of death, the epitaph archivist, the egg farrier, so many 
                musicians and poets, and two clever brothers who have written a song about every one of them.</p>
                <p>As promised:</p>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vImbwWXpznA?si=7vbebbxGtZ9zlmRr" title="YouTube video player"

                referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>(unfortunately, that is the <em>only</em> clip of this obscure project I was able to find. But it's pretty good. Hopefully the
                humor of the "movie" comes across in this clip of a man who turns farming tools into flutes.)</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>I will now briefly write about the other two films in a nested, unordered list!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://filmforum.org/film/the-last-of-sheila-new-yorker">The Last of Sheila, directed by Herbert Ross in 1973</a>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I saw this movie at Film Forum, at the recommendation of an old friend of mine that now work at Film Forum.</li>
                        <li>It's a "puzzle movie", in the typical form of a murder mystery. It was cowrote with Stephen Sondheim, who loved hosting
                            his own murder mystery-like puzzle games with his friends, a circle who included out director Herbert Ross.</li>
                        <li>I thought this movie was so much fun. It's imperfect, but I thought the set ups and characters were all so interesting.
                            Also the rare movie that gives you all the clues to figure out the mystery up front, but is not at all obvious about it.
                            Highly recommended!</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="https://filmforum.org/film/killer-of-sheep">Killer of Sheep, directed by Charles Burnett in 1978</a>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I saw this one at Film Forum as well, if I remember correct.</li>
                        <li>I've wanted to see this forever, and my girlfriend loves it, so we went together.</li>
                        <li>This one is a black comedy, that seems more dark than funny at first, but the humor builds up slowly throughout the movie.
                            A good quality. Too many movies are fatiguing by using too many gags in the first half hour or so.</li>
                        <li>Maybe the most visually striking movie of the three on this page.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
